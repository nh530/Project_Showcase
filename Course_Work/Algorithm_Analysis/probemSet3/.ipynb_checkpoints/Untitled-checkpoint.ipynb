    "Assume that the cost of any single arithmetic operation (adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing two real numbers) is 1, and that all other operations are free.  Consider the following variant of Strassen's algorithm: to multiply two n by n matrices, starting using Strassen's algorithm, but stop the recursino at some size $n_{0}$ - the crossover point.  Analytically determine the value of $n_{0}$ that optimizes the running time of this algorithm in this model.  This gives a crude estimate for the cross-over point between Strassen's algorithm and the standard matrix multiplication algorithm.  \n",

    "> The exact equation for the conventional algorithm is $T(n) = 2n^{3} - n^{2}$.  To compute each entry in the matrix product, there are $n$ multiplication steps and $n-1$ addition or subtraction steps, where n is size of the matrix.  The computed matrix there are $n^{2}$ entries.  Therefore, the number of steps is $n^{2}[(n) + (n-1)]$.  \n",
    "> The exact equation for strassen algorithm is $S(n) = 7S(n/2) + 18(n^{2}/4)$.  There are $18$ addition or subtraction steps in the post processing step.  Each of these $18$ additions or subtractions are on submatrices each with $n^{2}/4$ entries in each matrix.  Assuming addition and subtraction can be done in 1 step.  It is known that to compute a matrix addition or matrix subtraction, each entry in the final matrix is computed using 1 addition or subtraction.  Since there are $n^{2}/4$ entries in the final array, we know there must be $n^{2}/4$ additions or subtractions.  There are $7$ recursive calls.  \n",
    "> Lets say that n is equal the the size of the matrix that is at the crossover point.  Crossover point is defined as the point where matrices with size n that is less than the crossover point will have their matrix product be computed using conventional algorithm.  Since we're at the crossover point and not below it, we will call strassen algorithm 1 time.  At the recursive calls, the size of the submatrices are $n/2$.  Therefore, the matrix product of each of these submatrices will be computed using conventional algorithm.  \n",
    "> Therefore, $S(n) = 7S(n/2) + 18(n^{2}/4) = 7(2(n/2)^{3} -(n/2)^{2}) + 18(n^{2}/4)$.  This equation represents the modified Strassen algorithm that uses conventional algorithm to compute matrix multiplication when n is less than the crossover point.  \n",
    "> $2n^{3} - n^{2} = 7(2(n/2)^{3} -(n/2)^{2}) + 18(n^{2}/4)$ is solved for n.  Setting the two equations equal to each other is done because that corresponds to when the number of steps in conventional algorithm is equal to the number of steps in the modified Strassen algorithm.  And we know that conventional algorithm performs faster on smaller n.  This implies that the conventional algorithm is faster for n smaller than crossover point.  \n",
    "> Solving the above equation will give $n=15$.  Any matrix size below this point will have its matrix product computed using only conventional algorithm because it has less number of steps.  This results in the modified strassen algorithm being faster than a pure strassen algorithm and faster than the pure conventional algorithm.  \n",
    "> If n is not a power of 2, then the optimal crossover point really depends on the implementation of the padding procedure.  "

    "2. Experimental:  \n",
    "Implement your variant of Strassen's algorithm and the standard matrix multiplication algorithm to find the crossover point experimentally.  Experimentally optimize for $n_0$ and compare the experimental results with your estimate from above.  Make both implementations as efficient as possible.  The actual crossover point, which you would like to make as small as possible, will depend on how efficiently you implement strassens algorithm.  Your implementation should work for any matrices, not just those whose dimensions are a power of 2.  To test your algorithm, you might try matrices where each entry is randomly selected to be 0 or 1; similarly, you might try matrices where each entry is randomy selected to be 0, 1, 2 or instead 0, or 1, or -1.  You might also try matrices where each entry is a randomly selected real number in the range $[0,1]$.  You need not try all of these, but do test your algorithm adequately.  \n",
    "> Strassen.py contains all the code necessary for the implementation of strassen algorithm with modified crossover point.  The code is also modified to support non power of 2 matrices.  The algorithm will output all the diagonal entries of the final matrix product.  Originally, I had set the padding to turn any matrix that is not a power of 2 into a matrix with size that is a power of 2.  However, I realized that this padding function would add a lot of 0's, and make the matrix considerably bigger.  I believed that this would of had a significant impact on the runtime of the algorithm.  Instead, I decided to do multiple padding steps whenever a matrix is not divisible by 2.  In other words, if the matrix is not even, I made it even.  Although there would be multiple times in which the matrix would have 0's added, I believed that this would lead to less 0's when n is large.  Also, in python, list comprehensions are significantly faster than regular for loops.  Therefore, list comprehensions\n",
    "were used whenever possible to optimize performance.  The results correspond to the runtime of the modified strassen algorithm with different crossover points.  It makes no sense to compute the pure conventional runtime and then find the crossover point for the modified strassen algorithm that gives the equivalent runtime.  The reason we set the conventional runtime equal to the modified strassen runtime is because the n, the size of the input matrix, used at this situation gives the runtime the same for modified strassen and pure conventional algorithm.  In other words, the size of the input matrix will have the same runtime for conventional algo and modified strassen when used to compute matrix products.  However, the experimental procedure involves fixing the size of the input matrix n.  The runtime computed for the modified strassen algorithm includes the runtime for recursing the input matrix of size n down to a matrix of size that is equal to the crossover point.  As a result, the crossover point is the point at which the modified strassen algorithm gives the lowest runtime.  \n",
