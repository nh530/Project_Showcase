    "1. Prove that there is a unique minimum spanning tree on any connected undirected graph when the edge weights are unique.  \n",
    "Suppose G has unique edge weights.  Suppose X is the MST on G.  Lets replace an edge in X with another edge in graph G that still allows for the creation of MST.  This implies that edges that got swapped have the same edge weight because if we have a MST, then that means that the sum of edge weights is the minimum and the minimum is unique to a graph.  Therefore, this implies edge weights are not unique.  This leads to a contradiction, therefore, there must be a unique minimum spanning tree.    "

    "At each iteration, the correct subproblem solution is found.  For subproblem 1, the solution is simply the first element in A.  For subproblem 2, the algorithm compares A[1, 2] to A[2].  It is clear, that the solution to this subproblem is the max value of the comparison.  Assume that the algorithm correctly solves each problem for input size less than n.  Suppose Max_subarray_finder is called on an array of size n.  The inductive hypothesis implies that all the subproblems from 1 to n-1 are computed correctly.  On the nth subproblem, the algorithm will do B[n] <- max(B[n-1] + A[n], A[n]).  The inductive hypthesis implies that B[n-1] is the correct solution.  It is clear that the solution to the nth subproblem is that either max subarray contains the nth element or it doesn't.  Therefore, it is clear that B[n] will contain the correct solution.  The algorithm then returns the max value out of array B, which is the desired output.  "

    "The neatest page is determined by minimizing the sum of the penalty for all lines except last line where penalty $=(m-j+i- \\sum_{k=i}^{j}l_k)^3$.  $i-j$ is the number of spaces in the line.

For the ith subproblem, the minimum value from temp is stored in P and A[i] = W[1, 2, 3, ..., length(temp)] stores the words for line i.  The length of temp represents the final word to be added to the line.  The words that are added to A are then deleted from W and this is repeated until W is empty.  \n",

    "4. Another type of problem often suitable for dynamic programming is problems on tree graphs.  For example, suppose we have a graph G = (V, E) that is a tree with a root r.  Derive a recursion to find the size of the maximum-sized independent set of G.  (An independent set is a subset of graph vertices, such that no two have an edge between them).  For full credit, show that you can find the size of the maximum-sized independent set in linear time.  \n",

Assume trees have pointers to child nodes.  Let A[1, 2, ..., n] be array that contains the nodes of distance from high to low of tree rooted at R.  A is the reverse order of the distance of each node from r, which is calculated by BFS.  This is the order of the subproblems to solve.  Let I[i, i+1, ..., n] be the max size of independent set of subtree rooted at node i, where i, ..., n are nodes.  Therefore, I[i] = max(1+$\\sum_{x=grandchild}I(x)$, $\\sum_{x=child}I(x)$).

However, note that the algo does a constant amount of work when it checks out a node.  Notice that each vertex j is processed 3 times, 1 time when algo encounters j,  when j is a child, and when j is a grandchild.  This means each vertex is looked at 3 times and each time a constant amount of work is done.  This implies the overall runtime is O(n).  \n",

The algo solve sthe subproblem of finding the max independent set of subtree rooted at ith node by determining if i belongs to the set X or not.  If it belongs to X, then the size of set X is incremented by 1 by adding 1 to the sum of size of subtree rooted on i's grandchildren.  The only way this fails is if the graph is not a tree.  This is the case if there are cycles or if entire graph is not connected.  The proble massumes the graph is a tree.
