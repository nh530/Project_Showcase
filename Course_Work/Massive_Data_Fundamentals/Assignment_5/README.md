# Assignment - Machine Learning with SparkML

**You should thoroughly read through the entire assignment before beginning your work! Don't start the cluster until you are ready.**

## Start your cluster

Create an EMR cluster with **_Advanced Options_** and the following configuration:

* Select `emr-5.21.0` from the drop-down
* **Click check-boxes for these applications only**: Hadoop 2.8.5 and Spark 2.4.0
* Click Next
* **Edit the instance types and set 1 master and 8 core of m4.xlarge** 
* Click Next
* Give the cluster a name, and you can uncheck logging, debugging and termination protection enabled
* Click Next
* Select your key-pair
* Click "Create Cluster"

You should know the rest of the process by now. Makre sure you run the post-startup script.

### Provide the Master Node and Cluster Metadata

Provide the instance metadata. Run this command in the master node.

```
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document/ > instance-metadata.json
```

## Problem

In this assignment, you will work with the 2013 NYC Taxi Dataset [https://chriswhong.com/open-data/foil\_nyc\_taxi/](https://chriswhong.com/open-data/foil_nyc_taxi/). This is a precursor to the currently available NYC Taxi data and you can read more about it in the website.

The original data files were CSVs. However, for space saving and speed these files have been converted to [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) format.

There are two sets of Parquet files:

*  **Trip** data, located at `s3://bigdatateaching/nyctaxi-2013/parquet/trip`
*  **Fare** data, located at `s3://bigdatateaching/nyctaxi-2013/parquet/fare`

There are two parts to this homework, each in its own Jupyter notebook.

* [merge-data.ipynb](merge-data.ipynb): in this notebook you will create a merged and cleansed datasetand store it in **your S3 bucket**.
* [model-data.ipynb](model-data.ipynb): in this notebook you will work with the merged dataset you created in `merge-data.ipynb` and train one or more models  to predict wether a trip will receive a tip or not.

The data size is approximately 40GB uncompressed. This was thoroughly tested with the cluster configuration of 1 master and 8 core m4.xlarge machines (4 cores and 8GB RAM), which gives you a total of 128GB of theoretical memory to work with and 32 cores. Intensive operations should not take more than a few minutes each. **Even though Spark is relatively fast, it still takes time to process operations.**

In this assignment, we are giving you directions on what to do, but not how to do it. In each notebook there is a section at the end where you need to provide specific information. Please do not edit the structure of these cells.

### Some suggestions you should consider:

* Clone your repository to your laptop and review both notebooks before starting the assignment, and perhaps starting your cluster
* Use spot pricing for your cluster. With m4.xlarge machines, each machine costs $0.20/hr per machine time, plus the EMR fee of $0.06 for a total of $0.26 per machine per hour. You can save money with spot pricing (just on machine time, not on EMR cost.) Keep track of your spend!.
* Refer to the [PySpark Documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/index.html) and [Spark Documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/)
* Start early on this assignment, not two days before it is due. **This assignment will take more time than previous assignments.**
* Consider saving intermediate datasets in your S3 buckets, in [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) format. 
* Consider saving a model object in S3 after you train it, especially if training takes a while. To save a model object, use the following code: `model.save("s3://[[your-s3-bucket]]/model_location/")`
* When creating the Machine Learning pipelines, you may want to try it first on a small sample of your training data to make sure the pipelines work as planned. To create a tiny DataFrame, use the `limit` method: `df.limit(100)` (this creates a small DataFrame with the first 100 rows from df.)
* If you need to re-start your Jupyter notebook for any reason, make sure you close the Spark connection first **before** restarting the kernel. To do this, type either `sc.stop()` or `spark.stop()` in a cell. If you don't do this, YARN will not release resources previously allocated.

## Submitting the Assignment

Make sure you commit **only the files requested**, and push your repository to GitHub!

The files to be committed and pushed to the repository for this assignment are:

* `instance-metadata.json`
* `merge-data.ipynb`
* `model-data.ipynb`


## Grading Rubric 

-   We will look at the results files and/or scripts. If the result files are exactly what is expected, in the proper format, etc., we may run your scripts to make sure they produce the output. If everything works, you will get full credit for the problem.
-   If the submitted results are not what is expected, we will look at and run your code and provide partial credit wherever possible and applicable.
-   Points **will** be deducted for each the following reasons:
    -   Instructions are not followed
    -   Output is not in expected format (not sorted, missing fields, wrong delimiter, unusual characters in the files, etc.)
    -   There are more files in your repository than need to be
    -   There are additional lines in the results files (whether empty or not)
    -   Files in repository are not the requested filename
    -   Homework is late (unless you are using a late day and provide notice in advance)
